Letters from my brother James about the covid 19 virus 



Mine or othe peoples questions are in *italics* and typically start with *"Hi James"*

[Interesting Links](interesting-urls.md)



On March 17th my extended family started to receive emails from my brother James, a genetics researcher at Toronto SickKids Hospital, Ontario Canada.

I so appreciated the emails that I asked him if it would be OK to publish them on social media as others might want to hear what he has to say. He said that would be fine.

Hi All: It seems many people have a misimpression about virus spread – if you want advice from me (having worked with virus since age 21) lets talk. Section from a globe article below on students and elderly made me think of ... my son ... and his grandparents. By the way, Toronto Hospitals and the university are all shutting down their research labs for the next few weeks to focus on clinical issues. 

 

The pandemic has provided a new outlet for generational tensions, which can go in many directions. While university students disobeyed public-health officials and their parents to partake in St. Patrick’s Day festivities in Kingston, Ont., on the weekend, for example, defiance has flowed the other way, too.

The older set, predominantly baby boomers, who are healthier and more active than their parents were at the same age, can take offence to what they see as infantilization from their children; but members of generations X, Y and Z worry that mantras such as “70 is the new 50” have given their parents a false sense of security.

The fatality risk for COVID-19 is often reported as 2 per cent, but that’s for the overall population, pointed out Samir Sinha, the director of geriatrics at Toronto’s Sinai Health System and the University Health Network. "As soon as you start getting in your 60th, your 70th and your 80th-plus [year], we start seeing those death rates go into the 3-, 8- and 15-per-cent range,” he said.

I’m optimistic for Canada still, but the US is going to accelerate so closing that border makes more sense for us than for them. A few stats for a comparative perspective from 2019 for Canada that everyone accepts as routine life:

 

258,000 people die every year in Canada.

Traffic fatalities = 3000, Traffic serious injuries= 16,000

Flu deaths = 3500, Flu hospitalizations= 12,000

Opioid overdoses = 14,000 deaths (over last 4 years).

The coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 continually circulate in the human population and cause the common cold in adults and children world-wide.

This means that coronavirus transfers from animals to humans have occurred previously and we accept them as part of normal life.

 

COVID 19 – 620 cases, 8 deaths (all seniors) as of this morning. Children seemingly unaffected. 

 

New cases in Ontario are relatively stable over the past week.

March 12 = 18

March 13 = 19

March 14 = 24

March 15 = 42

March 16 = 32

March 17 = 13

March 18 = 22 so far today pending afternoon update.  Have to see if the trend goes up or down.

In BC there seems to have been a spike upwards yesterday.

And just 2 in the afternoon release from Ontario so a total of 24 today here. Ontario seems relatively stable for a week now.  Hard to tell with BC because that 83 spike might have been delayed tests over the weekend, but its still bigger numbers than we are seeing.

You probably never noticed, but you already lived through the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic and survived. 60 million cases, 275,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths in the US alone. 

Below is copied from https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html

2009 H1N1 Pandemic (H1N1pdm09 virus) | Pandemic Influenza (Flu) | CDC
The (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from H1N1 viruses that were circulating at the time of the pandemic. Few young people had any existing immunity (as detected by antibody response) to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus, but nearly one-third of people over 60 years old had antibodies against this virus, likely from exposure to an older H1N1 virus earlier in their lives.
www.cdc.gov


"In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged. It was detected first in the United States and spread quickly across the United States and the world....

From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus...

Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated..."

Hi everyone;
This is a long message with some updates and then my opinion for what its worth. It might be easier to read on a computer than a phone...  I will try to phone you all today. 

 

There are now about 600 Covid preprints on BioRXiv, and as reported this week viral proteins have been made in labs that can be used to detect antibodies produced by recovered patients.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-blood-tests-antibodies-could-show-true-scale-coronavirus-pandemic

https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181

 

The current Covid tests ask are patients actively making the virus (by detecting the virus RNA in nasal swabs) but cannot tell if someone was previously infected and no longer making virus (no virus RNA). The ability to test for antibodies is exciting for two reasons. 

 

1) people recovered by making antibodies against the virus, so an antibody test can identify everyone who is now protected even after having mild or no symptoms. And it can be used to test if vaccines are effective at inducing antibody production too (more on vaccines later).

 

2) There is a history of “passive immunity” treatments of viral infections, especially when there are significant numbers of recovered individuals and not enough time to make vaccines. The idea is one takes recovered donor blood, spins out the cells to isolate plasma which contains the antibodies. These antibodies can then be administered to hospitalized individuals to help them recover. If it works, that person will not have long term immunity because the transferred antibodies don’t last long. There are now significant numbers of recovered individuals (in China at least) who could become blood donors and are essentially factories producing the antibodies. Plasma can be quickly isolated by the Red Cross equivalent in every country that has enough recovered individuals. There are ways to engineer antibodies in the lab too but it takes longer.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_immunity

https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-drugs-can-antibodies-from-survivors-help/a-52806428

 

So what about vaccines? I was surprised to see that with the most difficult strains of Flu, those vaccines might only be effective for 30% of the population and last only 90 days or so. In other words, don’t get your flu vaccines too early in the fall, and some people recommend getting a second one in mid winter. Covid vaccines will take longer to develop because they need to be safety tested and produced in bulk, and might not be very effective.

 

In previous epidemics, by the time a vaccine was developed, so many people had already been infected that herd immunity emerged and the virus stopped spreading. That was the situation with Zika, when a vaccine was ready, it was no longer needed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker

 

 

Which brings us to herd immunity. The UK was considering just letting time take its course infecting the population and have the 99% of people recover, with enough making antibodies to protect themselves so that the virus has too few susceptible people to spread further. The problem of course is hospital capacity while the outbreak is at its peak.

 

Italy now has 54,000 cases in a population of 60 million or 0.1%. The canadian numbers doubled over the last week (600 to 1300). So if we assume a doubling time of one week, Italy goes from 0.1% to 3.2% in 5 weeks (if containment not effective). At that point (end of April), they have to decide if all the social distancing impact on the economy is still worth it, or should they just let Covid spread and allow healthy young-to-middle-age people to work. I have not seen any estimates of what population % is the threshold to make this decision, but that is crucially important. Presumably the British have some figure in mind, although they did belatedly go the social distancing route.

 

Canada is relatively less infected than most countries, but I still think that by Victoria Day (end of May) the decision between the economic well-being of the 99% and the 1% most susceptible population will have to be tackled. In the meantime, scale up the supply of ventilators and intensive care facilities/personnel, and assess whether passive immunity is an effective treatment that can be rapidly deployed internationally.

*Hi James and Family: Any ideas James how UV light helps reduce the typical flu? Just pondering why flu season is even a season. I guess people getting outside is a form of social distancing and herd immunity probably has an effect around March-April. Wondering if a metric like UV intensity x hours of sunlight plays a roll? https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20180212/can-uv-light-be-used-to-kill-airborne-flu-virus-#1  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466003/ https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180209100701.htm *

*Hey James: A person could become infected by breathing in one virus, but typically would become infected by breathing in a liquid droplet of many millions of the viruses. What is the difference between the two types of infections? Lets assume both people get mild versions of Covid-19? Would the single virus infection give the person more time to try to fight it? Or is a large amount needed before the body even starts to try to fight it?*
 
 
 
 Hi jer:
A single virus particle is very unlikely to be infective, that's why virus makes such a huge number of particles to pass on. In the lab, some types of virus can be made to levels of a billion or more in just 1 ml. I don't think there are calculations about what threshold number of virus particles are sufficient to transfer infection to a new host. But maybe one reason health care workers get bad cases is they get exposed to really high doses by patients in intensive care and have little time to respond. So I would imagine there is a trend to a dose response curve or a delay as you suggest. But the mild cases are likely to be some sort of resistance, or avoidance of hyper immunity that actually harms the lungs. Best,  james

 


*Thanks James I am kind of sad we are not doing what the Czech Republic is doing. I love when scientific theories have to look at real world results. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtEX2-n2Hc *

 Hi All:
That idea of transferring antibodies from recovered patients into those currently in intensive care has been reported, just on 5 patient cases, in China. 
Best,  james

Glad to hear you are staying at home mum and dad. I've been trying to figure out what to follow up with for content on COVID. But all I can come up with is huge criticism of the americans and I don't think that is a very useful perspective to share. Its hard to believe they have gone to 200k cases in just 10 days since I last commented.

At SickKids they have declared that research labs are closed indefinitely. But I can't see Toronto residents staying indoors as spring weather arrives - its much easier to hunker down at home when its cold or wet. At least I got our BBQ and patio furniture set up on the balcony today, and enjoyed a beer in the sun and some grilled lamb chops for dinner. Taking the stairs up to our 10th floor of the condo is reasonable exercise along with walks in the neighbourhood when its quiet out. Good luck with the physical distancing, with teaching / learning/ working remotely, and staying entertained and healthy.  Best,  James




Of course 2m is an arbitrary number, and one can just stay inside if you like. I wouldn't get too fixated on distance and masks though. I bet you take worse odds just living normal life and never paid attention.

If you don't have pre-existing lung/heart issues you might actually be better off getting it and fighting it off in order to become resistant. Then all the frantic self protection is much less relevant. We had N95 masks, gowns and gloves in the lab to work with our virus vectors, and gave them all to the hospital who absolutely require them to intubate patients for a ventilator at very close quarters. University of Toronto just sent out a newsletter saying that their research labs donated 175,000 gloves and 3000 N95s and gowns to the downtown hospitals for the same purpose. Other labs are using 3D printers to produce visors too.

My perspective is to limit contact as much as possible in order to contain spread and protect other more vulnerable people like our parents and John. But I'm not losing any sleep from worry. There is some movement towards encouraging people to use home made masks now, but the aim is mostly to prevent you coughing up on other people, not the other way round. And in that circumstance you should be in isolation.

Anyway, hope you don't look too much like a bank robber when you go out - don't want the cops to take you down!   Best,  James

*Thanks for the reply James but I sent you the wrong link. Here is the correct one. Interesting from a very capable person in the field of AI. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVEVve-3QeM&feature=youtu.be I agree with staying inside but people eventually have to leave there house to grocery shop. I think masks could help a bit at least give us time to find other ways to fight the virus.*
